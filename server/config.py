  Common gunicorn configuration

  Gunicorn uses the following order of precidence for configuration
  values:

  1. Command-line (highest)
  2. Environment variable
  3. File referenced by --config (lowest)

  Put configuration common across all deployment environments here and
  add environment-specific items to the GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS env var.

=======
  WARNING: You may be tempted to *pythonise* the command-line arguments
  - instead, make sure you look at this page: the headings are the
  names the variables should have:
