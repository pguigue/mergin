## About

Mergin Maps is a web platform for storage and synchronisation of geospatial projects across multiple users and devices (desktop and mobile).
The platform is especially useful when you need:

- **Mobile data collection.** If you need to capture location of assets (and their attributes) or update an existing database.

- **Data sharing.** No complicated setup of access by IT admins to get your data to colleagues or clients. Set up permissions and send invites with few clicks.

- **Offline access.** Work with data with no interruption even without constant Internet connection - sync any changes when you are back online.

- **Collaborative editing.** No more problems dealing with multiple copies of the same dataset in different versions - all changes are automatically consolidated in one place.

- **Audit changes.** Knowing who has changed what and when in a database is often important - Mergin Maps keeps track of the history and allows to go back if needed.

- **No coding required.** Everything can be set up with no knowledge of programming.

Mergin Maps organises all data in projects. A project in Mergin Maps is a directory containing various data files - GeoPackages,
QGIS project files, documents, pictures and more. As soon as a project is uploaded to Mergin Maps, it can be easily accessed directly from the web, from QGIS or from iOS/Android via our [mobile app](https://merginmaps.com/start-for-free).

You are currently browsing repository for Mergin Maps web server and web client. Our mobile app, QGIS plugin and integrations have standalone GitHub repositories, you can [find them here](https://github.com/MerginMaps).

- :camera: **Sync images** - Supporting sync of photos with common cloud storage using [mergin-media-sync](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/mergin-media-sync) tool
- üíΩ **Sync with database** - Supporting two-way sync of data with PostGIS using [mergin-db-sync](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/mergin-db-sync) tool
- üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Work packages** - Split main database to smaller chunks for teams using [mergin-work-packages](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/mergin-work-packages) tool

Mergin Maps offers a unique combination of features that other tools do not provide out of the box:

- relational databases (such as PostGIS or Oracle) are great for keeping a central repository of spatial data, but offline access, versioning and sharing outside of a single organisation are complicated to set up.

- traditional storage products (like Dropbox or Google Drive) are great for storage of large amounts of data (pictures/videos) and offering offline access, but concurrent access to data (e.g. a single vector layer) is not going to work well.
